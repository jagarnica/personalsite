### Welcome!

Finally, I have my first blog post up! I do not have exactly a degree in writing but despite that, I will take the risk of creating indecipherable scribbles and post about a variety of topics. I created this blog intending to discuss code, computing, and startups. I also will be covering some less Silicon Valley-esque things I am passionate about such as Hi-fi equipment, tech restorations, and coffee as well.

To make it less confusing on my readers (well all two of you for now), I've added tags to each post so you can know what to expect without even reading the title or description. I will add a way to sort them later down the line as well.

I should have my first **real** post soon so stick around!
