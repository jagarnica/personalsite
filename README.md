## Personal Website

This is my personal website. Feel free to use the source code for inspiration or if you want to just see how it runs. Big thanks to React, GatbysJs, and Typescript for making it happen. It is always a work in progress as well.

## Getting Started

Install the required packages:

```sh
npm i
```

To run the development build, just run:

```sh
gatsby develop
```
